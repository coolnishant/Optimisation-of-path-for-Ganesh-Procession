# Optimisation-of-path-for-Ganesh-Procession
Ganesha Chavithi is one of the most important religious festivals conducted through out India which includes Ganesha procession followed by Ganesha immersion. This procession leads to high traffic congestion which in-turn leads to disruption in routine activities of the citizens. This paper discusses about the various approaches that can be applied so that the traffic congestion can be minimized and thus resulting in comfort of common people. In this paper, we proposed a novel algorithm based on shortest distance for clustering and optimized MST algorithm for finding optimal path for each cluster of Ganeshas to itâ€™s Lake. and have also shown the results as implemented on google maps.
